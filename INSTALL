Installing Change Passwd Plugin
===============================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 3.1 version of the change_passwd
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf change_passwd-3.1-1.2.8.tar.gz


2) Change into the change_passwd directory, copy config.php.sample
   to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as
   you deem necessary.  

  $ cd change_passwd
  $ cp config.php.sample config.php
  $ vi config.php


3) Make sure the file permissions on the chpasswd file are
   correct (unless you'll be using the 'pw' utility on
   FreeBSD).  Substitue the name of the user that your web
   server runs under for "apache" in the command below:

  $ chown root:apache chpasswd
  $ chmod 4750 chpasswd


4) If you are running this under Solaris on a Sparc machine, you 
   probably need to recompile the chpasswd.c file:

  $ gcc -lcrypt -O -o chpasswd chpasswd.c

5) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl


6) Also, please verify that you have the "compatibility" plugin
   installed.



Upgrading Change Passwd Plugin
===============================

PLEASE NOTE that due to extensive changes made in version 4.0,
you should ENTIRELY remove any 3.x version of this plugin from
your plugins directory and reinstall this version from scratch
using the instructions above.

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 3.1 version of the change_passwd
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf change_passwd-3.1-1.2.8.tar.gz


2) Change into the change_passwd directory, check your config.php 
   file against the new version, to see if there are any new settings
   that you must add to your config.php file.

  $ diff -Nau config.php config.php.sample

   Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided sample
   and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the
   installation procedure above).
