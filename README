Ver 4.1, Apr 25, 2004

This is a Squirrelmail plugin to allow your users to change 
his/her system password in /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow

A suid C program is used to access and change the password,
so note that this requires some special setup on your part.


---REQUESTING HELP-----------------------

If you have any problems getting this plugin to work, please
make sure to read the TROUBLESHOOTING section below and include 
the information requested below with your help request, otherwise 
you will probably be ignored.

Please send help requests to the squirrelmail-plugins mailing
list:  information on this mailing list can be found on the 
SquirrelMail web site.  Contacting the authors of this plugin
should be your last resort (but we don't bite, either!).

Please include this information with your help request:

  - Operating system name and version

  - Web server name and version

  - User and group that your web server is running as...

    Try this from the command line if you are running 
    Apache and do not have this information:

      egrep "^[Uu][Ss][Ee][Rr]" APACHE_CONF_FILE | sed 's/^[^ ][^ ]* \([^ ][^ ]*\).*/\1/;q'
      egrep "^[Gg][Rr][Oo][Uu][Pp]" APACHE_CONF_FILE | sed 's/^[^ ][^ ]* \([^ ][^ ]*\).*/\1/;q'

    Where APACHE_CONF_FILE should be replaced BY YOU with 
    the location of your httpd.conf Apache configuration file.  
    Typical locations for this file are:

      /etc/httpd.conf
      /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

    Or try to find it by doing this:

      locate httpd.conf

    So, for example, on a Red Hat system, I can get the user 
    that Apache runs as by typing this at the command line:

      egrep "^[Uu][Ss][Ee][Rr]" /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | sed 's/^[^ ][^ ]* \([^ ][^ ]*\).*/\1/;q'

    And I get this back:

      apache

  - PHP version and configuration details
   
  - A cut and paste of the directory listing for this plugin:

      cd /path/to/squirrelmail/plugins/change_passwd
      ls -alF

  - A copy of the exact results of the output of steps 3 and 4
    from the TROUBLESHOOTING section below


---TROUBLESHOOTING-----------------------

1) Please read the INSTALL file and verify that you have actually
   followed every step.

2) Please verify that the ownership and permissions of the chpasswd
   binary (executable) file are correct.  The file should be executable 
   (and readable) by your web server user, and owned by root (with 
   suid bit set) (see step number 3 in the INSTALL file).  Its listing 
   should appear similar to this:

   -rwsr-x---    1 root     apache       9873 Oct 21  2002 chpasswd*

   Read the support section above to determine if the group ownership
   of this file should be "apache" or "nobody", etc.  It should exactly
   match the group which your web server is running as.

3) Turn on $seeOutput in config.php to see if the chpasswd program is
   returning any errors of note.

4) Please turn on the $debug flag in config.php and attempt to change
   your password.  It will show you two commands used to run the 
   chpasswd program from the command line - please paste them onto 
   the command line EXACTLY as they are shown and see if there are any
   errors.

   It should look something like this:

     cd /path/to/squirrelmail/plugins
     ../plugins/change_passwd/chpasswd 'my_user_name' 'my_old_pwd' 'my_new_pwd' 2>&1

   Make sure the user name and password information matches and that 
   the command can be run from the command line.  If you are having 
   problems on the command line, you might want to look for a different 
   version of the chpasswd program (either on the Internet or on your 
   own machine by typing "locate chpasswd").


---TODO----------------------------------

 * Along with checking for the config.php file, check that the
   permissions on the executable are correct (? this should not
   be done in the case of FreeBSD... is there any reason the 
   permissions will be different in other contexts?)
